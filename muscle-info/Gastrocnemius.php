        <h2>Gastrocnemius</h2>
        <p>The gastrocnemius muscle is a superficial two-headed muscle that is in the back part of
            the lower leg of humans. It runs from its two heads just above the knee to the heel, a three joint muscle
            (knee, ankle and subtalar joints). The muscle is named via Latin, from Greek γαστήρ (gaster) 'belly' or
            'stomach' and κνήμη (knḗmē) 'leg', meaning 'stomach of leg' (referring to the bulging shape of the calf).
        </p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>The gastrocnemius is located with the soleus in the posterior (back) compartment of the leg. The lateral head
            originates from the lateral condyle of the femur, while the medial head originates from the medial condyle
            of the femur. Its other end forms a common tendon with the soleus muscle; this tendon is known as the
            calcaneal tendon or Achilles tendon and inserts onto the posterior surface of the calcaneus, or heel bone.
            It is considered a superficial muscle as it is located directly under skin, and its shape may often be
            visualized through the skin.</p>
        <p>Deep to the gastrocnemius (farther from the skin) is the soleus muscle. Some anatomists consider both to be a
            single muscle—the triceps surae or "three-headed [muscle] of the calf"—since they share a common insertion
            via the Achilles tendon. The plantaris muscle and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles, which
            is involved in "locking" the knee from the standing position. Since the anterior compartment of the leg is
            lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior
            compartment. The soleus is superficial to the mid-shaft of the tibia.</p>

        <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
        <p>Tibial nerve from the sciatic, specifically, nerve roots S1–S2</p>

        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>Along with the soleus muscle, the gastrocnemius forms half of the calf muscle. Its function is plantar
            flexing the foot at the ankle joint and flexing the leg at the knee joint.</p>
        <p>The gastrocnemius is primarily involved in running, jumping and other "fast" movements of leg, and to a
            lesser degree in walking and standing. This specialization is connected to the predominance of white muscle
            fibers (type II fast twitch) present in the gastrocnemius, as opposed to the soleus, which has more red
            muscle fibers (type I slow twitch) and is the primary active muscle when standing still, as determined by
            EMG studies.</p>
        <p><span>Motor pathway</span></p>
        <p>The plan to use the gastrocnemius in running, jumping, knee and plantar flexing is created in the precentral
            gyrus in the cerebrum of the brain.[3] Once a plan is produced, the signal is sent to and down an upper
            motor neuron. The signal is passed through the internal capsule and decussates, or crosses, in the medulla
            oblongata, specifically in the lateral corticospinal tract.[4] The signal continues down through the
            anterior horn of the spinal cord where the upper motor neuron synapses with the lower motor neuron. Signal
            propagation continues down the anterior rami (Lumbar 4-5 and Sacral 1-5) of the sacral plexus. The sciatic
            nerve branches off of the sacral plexus in which the tibial and common fibular nerves are wrapped in one
            sheath. The tibial nerve eventually separates from the sciatic nerve and innervates the gastrocnemius
            muscle. Thus, completing the plan the brain had originally started with, so that the actions of running,
            standing, and jumping could be executed.</p>

            <h3>Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl</h3>
            <p>If you really want to add some size to that bicep bulge, one of the best bicep exercises to test out
                is the Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl. This variation helps to strengthen the upper section of
                your biceps brachii, helping you to achieve that large muscle growth you’ve been chasing. To perform
                the Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl properly;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On an incline bench, lie back with a dumbbell in each hand and palms facing forward.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your
                    shoulder.</li>
                <li>Pause, squeezing your bicep at the top.</li>
                <li>Slowly reverse the movement to return to start.</li>

            <h3>Seated Alternating Hammer Curl</h3>
            <p>While not necessarily the most well-known bicep exercise, the Hammer Curl is a favourite among
                bodybuilders and strongmen alike. This Seated Alternating Hammer Curl variation allows you to focus
                on each arm individually, concentrating on singular growth and isolation. Put simply, the Hammer
                Curl allows you to switch muscle groups, strengthening your biceps brachialis, a deeper muscle that
                will aid in overall strength and shape. To perform a Seated Alternating Hammer Curl;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit on a 90-degree bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing in toward your body and arms
                    extended straight toward the floor.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your

            <h3>Standing Reverse Barbell Curl</h3>
            <p>You definitely would have attempted a Barbell Curl at some point in your gym career, however,
                incorporating a reverse grip can significantly bolster your bicep workout. When you curl a weight
                with an overhand grip, you put further strain on the often underused brachioradialis. The Standing
                Reverse Barbell Curl is a great way to get your bicep muscles working, but remember, you don’t need
                to go heavy with these ones. Light weights will definitely do the trick. To perform Standing Reverse
                Barbell Curls;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms straight to the floor, shoulders back, while holding
                    a barbell with both hands.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbows and shoulders stationary, slowly lift the weight to the front of your
                    shoulders.</li>

            <h3>Seated Alternating Dumbbell Curl</h3>
            <p>When you’re making a list of the most important bicep exercises to add to your workout regime, you
                simply cannot ignore the dumbbell curl. One of the most iconic and simple movements, curls are great
                for activating your forearm and upper arm muscles. However, research published in the Journal of
                Sports Science and Medicine shows that the Seated Alternating variation is the best version of the
                iconic bicep exercise. This take reportedly activated your biceps far better than other curl
                variations.

                As with most lifting, the heavier the weight, the stronger your biceps will get, however, it is
                important to make sure you contract at the top of the movement. To perform an a Seated Alternating
                Dumbbell Curl properly;</p>

            <p>Forget what you think you know about cable-work. Cables are actually a great way to work out
                different sections of your body, in particular, the bicep brachioradialis. The Standing Cable Curl
                allows you to keep consistent resistance, increasing the strain on your muscles and giving you a far
                more efficient bicep workout. To perform Standing Cable Curls;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart facing a cable machine with the machine’s handle on the
                    lowest setting.</li>

            <p>Once you’ve got the more complex curl variations out of the way, you should return back to the old
                faithful. The Standing Barbell Curl is traditionally the most common bicep exercise, and for good
                reason. Barbells allow you to work both arms simultaneously and evenly, which is great for stability
                and control. To perform a Standing Barbell Curl;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Standing tall, hold the barbell with a wide, underhand grip.</li>
