        <h2>Biceps</h2>
        <p>The biceps is a large muscle that lies on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the
            elbow. Both heads of the muscle arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which is
            attached to the upper forearm. While the biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints, its main
            function is at the elbow where it flexes the forearm and supinates the forearm. Both these movements are
            used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps screws in the cork (supination), then it pulls
            the cork out (flexion).</p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>The biceps is one of three muscles in the anterior compartment of the upper arm, along with the
            brachialis muscle and the coracobrachialis muscle, with which the biceps shares a nerve supply. The
            biceps muscle has two heads, the short head and the long head, distinguished according to their origin
            at the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, respectively. From its origin on
            the glenoid, the long head remains tendinous as it passes through the shoulder joint and through the
            intertubercular groove of the humerus. Extending from its origin on the coracoid, the tendon of the
            short head runs adjacent to the tendon of the coracobrachialis as the conjoint tendon. Unlike the other
            muscles in the anterior compartment of the arm, the biceps muscle crosses two joints, the shoulder joint
            and the elbow joint.</p>
        <p>Both heads of the biceps join in the middle upper arm to form a single muscle mass usually near the
            insertion of the deltoid to form a common muscle belly, although several anatomic studies have
            demonstrated that the muscle bellies remain distinct structures without confluent fibers. As the
            muscle extends distally, the two heads rotate 90 degrees externally before inserting onto the radial
            tuberosity. The short head inserts distally on the tuberosity while the long head inserts proximally
            closer to the apex of the tuberosity. The bicipital aponeurosis, also called the lacertus fibrosus,
            is a thick fascial band that organizes close to the musculotendinous junction of the biceps and radiates
            over and inserts onto the ulnar part of the antebrachial fascia.</p>
        <p>The tendon that attaches to the radial tuberosity is partially or completely surrounded by a bursa, the
            bicipitoradial bursa, which ensures frictionless motion between the biceps tendon and the proximal
            radius during pronation and supination of the forearm.</p>
        <p>Two muscles lie underneath the biceps brachii. These are the coracobrachialis muscle, which like the
            biceps attaches to the coracoid process of the scapula, and the brachialis muscle which connects to the
            ulna and along the mid-shaft of the humerus. Besides those, the brachioradialis muscle is adjacent to
            the biceps and also inserts on the radius bone, though more distally.</p>

        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>The biceps works across three joints. The most important of these functions is to supinate the
            forearm and flex the elbow. Besides, the long head of biceps prevents the upward displacement of the
            head of the humerus. In more detail, the actions are, by joint:</p>
        <p> <span> Proximal radioulnar joint of the elbow </span> – The biceps brachii function as a powerful
            supinator of the forearm, i.e. it turns the palm upwards. This action, which is aided by the supinator
            muscle, requires the humeroulnar joint of the elbow to be at least partially flexed. If the humeroulnar
            joint, is fully extended, supination is then primarily carried out by the supinator muscle. The biceps
            is a particularly powerful supinator of the forearm due to the distal attachment of the muscle at the
            radial tuberosity, on the opposite side of the bone from the supinator muscle. When flexed, the biceps
            effectively pulls the radius back into its neutral supinated position in concert with the supinator
            muscle.</p>
        <p> <span> Humeroulnar joint of the elbow </span> – The biceps brachii also functions as an important flexor
            of the forearm, particularly when the forearm is supinated. Functionally, this action is performed when
            lifting an object, such as a bag of groceries or when performing a biceps curl. When the forearm is in
            pronation (the palm faces the ground), the brachialis, brachioradialis, and supinator function to flex
            the forearm, with minimal contribution from the biceps brachii. It is also important to note that
            regardless of forearm position, (supinated, pronated, or neutral) the force exerted by the biceps
            brachii remains the same; however, the brachioradialis has a much greater change in exertion depending
            on position than the biceps during concentric contractions. That is, the biceps can only exert so much
            force, and as forearm position changes, other muscles must compensate.</p>
        <p> <span> Glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) </span> – Several weaker functions occur at the glenohumeral
            joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm
            forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the
            arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with
            horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially)
            rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or
            shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the
            arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding the head of the humerus in the
            glenoid cavity.</p>

            <h3>Standing Reverse Barbell Curl</h3>
            <p>You definitely would have attempted a Barbell Curl at some point in your gym career, however,
                incorporating a reverse grip can significantly bolster your bicep workout. When you curl a weight
                with an overhand grip, you put further strain on the often underused brachioradialis. The Standing
                Reverse Barbell Curl is a great way to get your bicep muscles working, but remember, you don’t need
                to go heavy with these ones. Light weights will definitely do the trick. To perform Standing Reverse
                Barbell Curls;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms straight to the floor, shoulders back, while holding
                    a barbell with both hands.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbows and shoulders stationary, slowly lift the weight to the front of your

            <h3>Seated Alternating Dumbbell Curl</h3>
            <p>When you’re making a list of the most important bicep exercises to add to your workout regime, you
                simply cannot ignore the dumbbell curl. One of the most iconic and simple movements, curls are great
                for activating your forearm and upper arm muscles. However, research published in the Journal of
                Sports Science and Medicine shows that the Seated Alternating variation is the best version of the
                iconic bicep exercise. This take reportedly activated your biceps far better than other curl
                variations.

                As with most lifting, the heavier the weight, the stronger your biceps will get, however, it is
                important to make sure you contract at the top of the movement. To perform an a Seated Alternating
                Dumbbell Curl properly;</p>
