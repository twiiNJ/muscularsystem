        <h2>Vastus Medialis</h2>
        <p>The vastus medialis (vastus internus or teardrop muscle) is an extensor muscle located medially in the thigh
            that extends the knee. The vastus medialis is part of the quadriceps muscle group.</p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The vastus medialis is a muscle present in the anterior compartment of thigh, and is one of the four
                muscles that make up the quadriceps muscle. The others are the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius and
                rectus femoris. It is the most medial of the "vastus" group of muscles. The vastus medialis arises
                medially along the entire length of the femur, and attaches with the other muscles of the quadriceps in
                the quadriceps tendon.</li>
            <li>The vastus medialis muscle originates from a continuous line of attachment on the femur, which begins on
                the front and middle side (anteromedially) on the intertrochanteric line of the femur. It continues down
                and back (posteroinferiorly) along the pectineal line and then descends along the inner (medial) lip of
                the linea aspera and onto the medial supracondylar line of the femur. The fibers converge onto the inner
                (medial) part of the quadriceps tendon and the inner (medial) border of the patella.</li>
            <li>The obliquus genus muscle is the most distal segment of the vastus medialis muscle. Its specific
                training plays an important role in maintaining patella position and limiting injuries to the knee. With
                no clear delineation, it is simply the most distal group of fibers of the vastus medialis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
        <p>Femoral nerve</p>

        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>The vastus medialis is one of four muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh. It is involved in knee
            extension, along with the other muscles which make up the quadriceps muscle. The vastus medialis also
            contributes to correct tracking of the patella.</p>
        <p>A division of the vastus medialis muscle into two groups of fibers has been hypothesized, a long and
            relatively inline group of fibres with the quadriceps ligament, the vastus medialis longus; and a shorter
            and more obliquely oriented with group of fibres, the vastus medialis obliquus. There is as yet insufficient
            evidence to conclusively confirm or deny this hypothesis.</p>

            <h3>Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl</h3>
            <p>If you really want to add some size to that bicep bulge, one of the best bicep exercises to test out
                is the Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl. This variation helps to strengthen the upper section of
                your biceps brachii, helping you to achieve that large muscle growth you’ve been chasing. To perform
                the Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl properly;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On an incline bench, lie back with a dumbbell in each hand and palms facing forward.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your
                    shoulder.</li>
                <li>Pause, squeezing your bicep at the top.</li>
                <li>Slowly reverse the movement to return to start.</li>
                <li>Repeat on the opposite side.</li>

            <h3>Seated Alternating Hammer Curl</h3>
            <p>While not necessarily the most well-known bicep exercise, the Hammer Curl is a favourite among
                bodybuilders and strongmen alike. This Seated Alternating Hammer Curl variation allows you to focus
                on each arm individually, concentrating on singular growth and isolation. Put simply, the Hammer
                Curl allows you to switch muscle groups, strengthening your biceps brachialis, a deeper muscle that
                will aid in overall strength and shape. To perform a Seated Alternating Hammer Curl;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit on a 90-degree bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing in toward your body and arms
                    extended straight toward the floor.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your
                    shoulder.</li>

            <h3>Standing Reverse Barbell Curl</h3>
            <p>You definitely would have attempted a Barbell Curl at some point in your gym career, however,
                incorporating a reverse grip can significantly bolster your bicep workout. When you curl a weight
                with an overhand grip, you put further strain on the often underused brachioradialis. The Standing
                Reverse Barbell Curl is a great way to get your bicep muscles working, but remember, you don’t need
                to go heavy with these ones. Light weights will definitely do the trick. To perform Standing Reverse
                Barbell Curls;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms straight to the floor, shoulders back, while holding
                    a barbell with both hands.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbows and shoulders stationary, slowly lift the weight to the front of your
                    shoulders.</li>
                <li>Pause, squeezing your bicep at the top.</li>

            <h3>Seated Alternating Dumbbell Curl</h3>
            <p>When you’re making a list of the most important bicep exercises to add to your workout regime, you
                simply cannot ignore the dumbbell curl. One of the most iconic and simple movements, curls are great
                for activating your forearm and upper arm muscles. However, research published in the Journal of
                Sports Science and Medicine shows that the Seated Alternating variation is the best version of the
                iconic bicep exercise. This take reportedly activated your biceps far better than other curl
                variations.

                As with most lifting, the heavier the weight, the stronger your biceps will get, however, it is
                important to make sure you contract at the top of the movement. To perform an a Seated Alternating
                Dumbbell Curl properly;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit on a 90-degree bench with a dumbbell in each hand and palms facing forward.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your
                    shoulder.</li>

            <h3>Standing Cable Curl</h3>
            <p>Forget what you think you know about cable-work. Cables are actually a great way to work out
                different sections of your body, in particular, the bicep brachioradialis. The Standing Cable Curl
                allows you to keep consistent resistance, increasing the strain on your muscles and giving you a far
                more efficient bicep workout. To perform Standing Cable Curls;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart facing a cable machine with the machine’s handle on the
                    lowest setting.</li>
                <li>Hold the handle with both hands palm facing forward and arms extended straight to the floor.

            <h3>Standing Barbell Curl</h3>
            <p>Once you’ve got the more complex curl variations out of the way, you should return back to the old
                faithful. The Standing Barbell Curl is traditionally the most common bicep exercise, and for good
                reason. Barbells allow you to work both arms simultaneously and evenly, which is great for stability
                and control. To perform a Standing Barbell Curl;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Standing tall, hold the barbell with a wide, underhand grip.</li>
                <li>Starting with the bar at hip height, squeeze your core and contract your biceps to curl the bar
                    up to shoulder height.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbows and shoulders stationary, slowly lift the weight to the front of your
                    shoulders.</li>

            <p>This multi-movement piece is one of the best bicep exercises you can add to your arm arsenal. The
                Zottman Curl focuses on all three major muscles that make up the biceps – the biceps brachii,
                brachialis and the brachioradialis. To perform the Zottman Curl;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hold arms at your side with a dumbbell in each hand.</li>

                <li>Pause, then rotate the dumbbells so your palms face forward again.</li>
