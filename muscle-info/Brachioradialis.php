        <h2>Brachioradialis</h2>
        <p>The brachioradialis is a muscle of the forearm that flexes the forearm at the elbow. It is also capable of
            both pronation and supination, depending on the position of the forearm. It is attached to the distal
            styloid process of the radius by way of the brachioradialis tendon, and to the lateral supracondylar ridge
            of the humerus.
        </p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>The brachioradialis is a superficial, fusiform muscle on the lateral side of the forearm that attaches
            proximally on the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and distally on the radius, close to its
            styloid process. Near the elbow, it forms the lateral limit of the cubital fossa, or elbow pit.</p>

        <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
        <p>Despite the bulk of the muscle body being visible from the anterior aspect of the forearm, the
            brachioradialis is a posterior compartment muscle and consequently is innervated by the radial nerve. Of the
            muscles that receive innervation from the radial nerve, it is one of only four that receive input directly
            from the radial nerve. The other three are the triceps, anconeus, and extensor carpi radialis longus. All
            other posterior compartment muscles that receive radial innervation are supplied by the deep branch of the
            radial nerve.</p>

        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow. When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis tends
            to supinate as it flexes. In a supinated position, it tends to pronate as it flexes. This also assists the
            biceps brachii.</p>
        <p>The brachioradialis is a stronger elbow flexor when the forearm is in a midposition between supination and
            pronation at the radioulnar joint. When pronated, the brachioradialis is more active during elbow flexion
            since the biceps brachii is in a mechanical disadvantage.</p>
        <p>With the insertion of the muscle so far from the fulcrum of the elbow, the brachioradialis does not generate
            as much joint torque as the brachialis or the biceps. It is effective mainly when those muscles have already
            partially flexed at the elbow. The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow, especially when quick
            movement is required and when a weight is lifted during slow flexion of the forearm.</p>
        <p>The muscle is used to stabilize the elbow during rapid flexion and extension while in a midposition, such as
            in hammering. The brachioradialis is synergistic with the brachialis and biceps brachii; the triceps brachii
            and anconeus are antagonistic.</p>

            <h3>Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl</h3>
            <p>If you really want to add some size to that bicep bulge, one of the best bicep exercises to test out
                is the Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl. This variation helps to strengthen the upper section of
                your biceps brachii, helping you to achieve that large muscle growth you’ve been chasing. To perform
                the Alternating Incline Dumbbell Curl properly;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On an incline bench, lie back with a dumbbell in each hand and palms facing forward.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your
                    shoulder.</li>
                <li>Pause, squeezing your bicep at the top.</li>
                <li>Slowly reverse the movement to return to start.</li>
                <li>Repeat on the opposite side.</li>

            <h3>Seated Alternating Hammer Curl</h3>
            <p>While not necessarily the most well-known bicep exercise, the Hammer Curl is a favourite among
                bodybuilders and strongmen alike. This Seated Alternating Hammer Curl variation allows you to focus
                on each arm individually, concentrating on singular growth and isolation. Put simply, the Hammer
                Curl allows you to switch muscle groups, strengthening your biceps brachialis, a deeper muscle that
                will aid in overall strength and shape. To perform a Seated Alternating Hammer Curl;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit on a 90-degree bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing in toward your body and arms
                    extended straight toward the floor.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your
                    shoulder.</li>
                <li>Pause, squeezing your bicep at the top.</li>

            <h3>Standing Reverse Barbell Curl</h3>
            <p>You definitely would have attempted a Barbell Curl at some point in your gym career, however,
                incorporating a reverse grip can significantly bolster your bicep workout. When you curl a weight
                with an overhand grip, you put further strain on the often underused brachioradialis. The Standing
                Reverse Barbell Curl is a great way to get your bicep muscles working, but remember, you don’t need
                to go heavy with these ones. Light weights will definitely do the trick. To perform Standing Reverse
                Barbell Curls;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms straight to the floor, shoulders back, while holding
                    a barbell with both hands.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbows and shoulders stationary, slowly lift the weight to the front of your
                    shoulders.</li>

            <h3>Seated Alternating Dumbbell Curl</h3>
            <p>When you’re making a list of the most important bicep exercises to add to your workout regime, you
                simply cannot ignore the dumbbell curl. One of the most iconic and simple movements, curls are great
                for activating your forearm and upper arm muscles. However, research published in the Journal of
                Sports Science and Medicine shows that the Seated Alternating variation is the best version of the
                iconic bicep exercise. This take reportedly activated your biceps far better than other curl
                variations.

                As with most lifting, the heavier the weight, the stronger your biceps will get, however, it is
                important to make sure you contract at the top of the movement. To perform an a Seated Alternating
                Dumbbell Curl properly;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit on a 90-degree bench with a dumbbell in each hand and palms facing forward.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbow and shoulder stationary, slowly lift one weight to the front of your
                    shoulder.</li>

            <p>Forget what you think you know about cable-work. Cables are actually a great way to work out
                different sections of your body, in particular, the bicep brachioradialis. The Standing Cable Curl
                allows you to keep consistent resistance, increasing the strain on your muscles and giving you a far
                more efficient bicep workout. To perform Standing Cable Curls;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart facing a cable machine with the machine’s handle on the
                    lowest setting.</li>
                <li>Hold the handle with both hands palm facing forward and arms extended straight to the floor.

            <p>Once you’ve got the more complex curl variations out of the way, you should return back to the old
                faithful. The Standing Barbell Curl is traditionally the most common bicep exercise, and for good
                reason. Barbells allow you to work both arms simultaneously and evenly, which is great for stability
                and control. To perform a Standing Barbell Curl;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Standing tall, hold the barbell with a wide, underhand grip.</li>
                <li>Starting with the bar at hip height, squeeze your core and contract your biceps to curl the bar
                    up to shoulder height.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbows and shoulders stationary, slowly lift the weight to the front of your
                    shoulders.</li>
